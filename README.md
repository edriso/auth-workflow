# auth-workflow

Welcome to the User Authentication Workflow project! This application provides a robust authentication system with features like email verification, password reset, and secure token management. This is another project from John Smilga's node.js course where the frontend was crafted by him, and my work was related to the backend in `server` folder.

## Key Features

- **Email Verification:** Verify user emails securely, enhancing account authenticity.
- **Password Reset:** Enable users to reset passwords seamlessly, ensuring hassle-free access recovery.
- **Secure Token Management:** Implement robust token management, enhancing user data security.
